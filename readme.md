# Distributor Custom Fields add on

## Requirements

A multisite that has sites linked through `Internal Connections`.

## Need to know
- Currently only supports Internal Connections.
- Don't use ACF groups !== supported. Finding post_id's in those meta field key is a bit tricky because how these fields are saved by ACF (`groupkey_fieldkey`).
- I have disabled the auto scalling of WordPress so that it won't create `lorem-scaled.jpg` files.
